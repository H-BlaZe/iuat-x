## How It Works

- **Attendance Processing**: The extension checks your attendance data and highlights rows where attendance is below 75%. It also calculates how many classes you need to attend or can skip to maintain or improve your attendance percentage.

- **Cumulative Attendance Update**: The cumulative attendance percentage displayed on the page is updated with a trend indicator (ðŸ“‰ or ðŸ“ˆ) based on the current attendance rate.

## Troubleshooting

- If the extension doesn't seem to work, ensure you're on the correct URL: [https://sms.iul.ac.in/Student/Attendance.aspx](https://sms.iul.ac.in/Student/Attendance.aspx).
- Make sure you have enabled Developer Mode and installed the `.crx` file correctly.
