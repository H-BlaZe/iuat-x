# IUAT-X Chrome Extension ðŸš€

## Description

**IUAT-X** is a Chrome extension designed to help [Integral University](iul.ac.in) students monitor their attendance. It processes attendance data from the specified URL and highlights rows with low attendance. Additionally, it provides actionable insights to improve or maintain attendance rates.

## Features

- Highlights attendance rows with low attendance in red.
- Shows recommendations to improve attendance.
- Updates cumulative attendance display based on thresholds.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the IUAT-X Chrome extension on your browser:

1. **Download the Extension**

   Download the `.crx` file from the [release page](https://github.com/H-BlaZe/iuat-x/releases/) on GitHub..

2. **Install the Extension in Chrome**

   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
   - Drag and drop the `.crx` file into the Chrome Extensions page.
   - Confirm the installation by clicking **Add Extension** when prompted.

3. **Accessing the Extension**

   - After installation, navigate to [https://sms.iul.ac.in/](https://sms.iul.ac.in/) and then navigate to to the attendance page.
   - The extension will automatically process the attendance data and update the table according to the rules defined.

## How It Works

- **Attendance Processing**: The extension checks your attendance data and highlights rows where attendance is below 75%. It also calculates how many classes you need to attend or can skip to maintain or improve your attendance percentage.

- **Cumulative Attendance Update**: The cumulative attendance percentage displayed on the page is updated with a trend indicator (ðŸ“‰ or ðŸ“ˆ) based on the current attendance rate.

## Troubleshooting

- If the extension doesn't seem to work, ensure you're on the correct URL: [https://sms.iul.ac.in/Student/Attendance.aspx](https://sms.iul.ac.in/Student/Attendance.aspx).
- Make sure you have enabled Developer Mode and installed the `.crx` file correctly.
